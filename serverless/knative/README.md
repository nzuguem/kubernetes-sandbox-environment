# Serverless - [Knative][knative-doc]

## KÃ©sako ?

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to build deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads.

It's a Google project, originally initiated for the Cloud Run service, and later opensourced so that anyone can run serverless on any Kubernetes distribution.

Knative consists of 3 components :

- **[Knative Serving](serving/README.md)**
- **[Knative Eventing](eventing/README.md)**
- Knative Build : Serverless Pipelines (*It's now a separate project called **Tekton***)
